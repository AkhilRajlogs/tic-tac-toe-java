# Tic Tac Toe (Java)  

A console-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Java to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and basic game development.  

## Project Overview  
This is my learning project to practice Java OOP and console-based game design.  
This project simulates a two-player Tic Tac Toe game in the console.  
The design uses separate classes for `TicTacToe`, `Player`, and `Board` to demonstrate encapsulation, modularity, and clean code structure.  

While learning this, I have a lot of interesting future implementations planned as I progress my learning journey, but for now taking one step at a time.  

## Current Status  
- Project structure created.  
- Core classes implemented:  
  - `TicTacToe.java` — main game control and flow.  
  - `Player.java` — stores player name and symbol.  
  - `Board.java` — manages board state and moves.  
- Game logic and input handling still in progress. 
- This project is intentionally incomplete and is being built incrementally to practice Java OOP concepts and industry-standard Git/GitHub workflows.    

## Planned Features  
- Accept player input.  
- Display board in the console.  
- Validate moves and symbols.  
- Detect win or draw conditions.  
- Future learning milestones:  
  - Make a webpage-based intuitive TicTacToe Game.  
  - Increase board size.  
  - Add AI player.  

## How to Run  
1. Open the project in VS Code (or any Java IDE).  
2. Compile and run `TicTacToe.java`.  
3. Follow console prompts to play.
