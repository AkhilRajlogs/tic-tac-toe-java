# Tic Tac Toe (Java)  

A console-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Java to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and incremental project development.  

## Project Overview  
This is my learning project to practice Java OOP and incremental project development using Git/GitHub.  
This project simulates a two-player Tic Tac Toe game in the console.  

**Key design principles:**  

- Separation of concerns — different classes handle different responsibilities (`TicTacToe`, `Player`, `Board`).  

- Encapsulation & modularity — each class exposes only what’s needed.  

I chose this project because it has scope for many interesting future implementations as I progress in my learning journey, but for now I am taking one step at a time.  

## Learning Goals  
- Practice Java OOP design.  
- Get comfortable with Git/GitHub workflows.  
- Build a complete console-based game incrementally.  

## Current Status  
- Project structure and core classes implemented:  
  - `TicTacToe.java` — main game control and flow.  
  - `Player.java` — stores player name and symbol.  
  - `Board.java` — manages board state and moves.  
- This game is now fully playable in the console.  
- Input handling implemented.  
- Used an enum to distinguish game outcomes.  
- Designed with future extensibility and clear separation of responsibilities in mind.  

## Planned Features  
- Refactor / modify code to match DRY principle, if not at the cost of readability and simplicity.  
- Future learning milestones:  
  - Make a webpage-based intuitive Tic Tac Toe Game.  
  - Implement with an increased board size.  
  - Add AI player.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Compile and run `TicTacToe.java` using any Java setup (IDE or command line).  
3. Follow console prompts to play.  

## Tech Stack  
- Java  
- VS Code
